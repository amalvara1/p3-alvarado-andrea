                    <p>Hey there- so let's talk Chameleon Sol! It all started with Andrea, our CEO and creative director. Her creative spirit was the spark that ignited the fire that we know as Chameleon Sol. She originally began her creative endeavors as a painter and submitting into art galleries in the RDU and JAX area. After some time in her studio, she became facinated with the thought of making wearable art. with this thought, she self-taught her way into screen-printing and designing dream graphics that she could never find at her local retailers.  </p>

                <div class="about-text-2">
                    <p>Since her screen-printing journey began, she has launched multiple SOLD-OUT styles. She has designed and printed exclusive graphics for local business, Town Beer Co. and continues to work with local brick-and-mortar stores to carry her products. She currently resides in Jacksonville, FL where she lives with her fiance and two dogs.  </p>
